# Fun With Basic Data Structures In JavaScript!

### Intro

To run the tests I've written, you first need to install `mocha` and `expect.js`. You can do this simply by running

```bash
npm run setup
```

Then you can simply do `mocha` to automatically run all the tests in the `test` folder.

### OOP

I'm making heavy use of the ES2015 `class` syntax to facilitate object-oriented design. This project is cool because I'm exploring many of the fundamentals of OOP.

#### Encapsulation

#### Inheritance

#### Polymorphism

#### Open recursion

***

_This uses a lot of the new ES2015 features. It works on Node v5.6.0, but may not work on older versions._
