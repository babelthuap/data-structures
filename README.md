# Playing With Data Structures in JavaScript

Fun with basic data structures! I'm making heavy use of the ES2015 `class` syntax to facilitate object-oriented design. This project is fun because I'm exploring many of the fundamentals of OOP.

### Encapsulation

### Inheritance

### Polymorphism

### Open recursion

_This uses a lot of the new ES2015 features. It works on Node v5.6.0, but may not work on older versions._
